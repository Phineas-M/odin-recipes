      <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1 (45 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
      <li>2 cups fat-free ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ cup dried parsley</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>10 lasagna noodles, or more as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot pot with onion, garlic, oregano, and basil until beef is completely browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce and spinach into ground beef mixture; simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir ricotta cheese, 8 ounces mozzarella cheese, parsley, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread a small amount of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Arrange lasagna noodles in a single layer over sauce. Spread another layer of sauce over top and arrange another layer of lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread 1/2 the remaining sauce and 1/2 the cheese mixture over top. Repeat layers, finishing with sauce. Cover the pan with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 55 minutes, remove the aluminum foil, sprinkle lasagna with 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, and bake until noodles are cooked through and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
